        <p>
            Quizzems is a trivia platform designed to help study for bar trivia.
            With the design pillars to load quickly so that if you are on the
            train or otherwise lose connection, you don't have to wait to get
            back online, and also to be free of intrusive ads and bloat.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's also easy for anyone to create their own quizzes, I strive to
            make the process as streamlined as possible so you can quickly and
            easily set up a new quiz from wherever you are, and edit at your
            leisure. Save drafts, edit images and answers, keep your quiz
            private until you're ready to share it!
